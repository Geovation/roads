## Data

### Formatting

In order to be eligible for parsing, OS and OSM data sets need to be converted into JSON format. Once you have your original GML/OSM files, these can be converted into JSON by running the following command. When converting OSM Data Files, it may ask you to confirm which layer you would like to transform, in this case, append the word `lines` to the end of the command below.

```
ogr2ogr -dim 2 -f GeoJSON -s_srs "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.999601 +x_0=400000 +y_0=-100000 +ellps=airy +units=m +no_defs +nadgrids=./OSTN15_NTv2_OSGBtoETRS.gsb" -t_srs EPSG:4326 "./name_of_output.json" "./name_of_input.gml"
```

Once a file has been successfully converted, these files can then be parsed to extract all of the one-way roads so that they can be compared across data sets in order to determine identical roads.
